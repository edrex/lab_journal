My technology lab notebook


## Design

 - Each entry is meant to explore/demonstrate just one thing
 - not a dependency of anything else

This is a place for me to experiment freely with collaborators: quick sketches, tech support, and documenting esoterica.

If something in here proves to be useful, it can graduate to its own repo, leaving a link in the entry's README.

## Meta

- `projects/`
  - `journal`
  - `src`

I think this should be a `journal` subdir in a meta repo (maybe called `lab`?), containing as submodules all my various projects.
