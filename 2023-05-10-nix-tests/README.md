Let's figure out how to do testing in flakes.

* [Unit Test Your Nix Code - Tweag](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-09-01-unit-test-your-nix-code/)
* [nix-community/nixt](https://github.com/nix-community/nixt), which was recommended in chat. A straightforward spec implementation for nix, great.
* [nix-community/namaka](https://github.com/nix-community/namaka) was also mentioned, but the snapshot testing thing seems somewhat specialized for my needs. Shouldn't it fit into a more general testing system?
